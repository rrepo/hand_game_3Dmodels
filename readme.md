This 3D models has fatal flaws.
- Holes of keys are too tite in some places.
    - I had to Sand it.
- The keys side of index finger and side of index finger didn't fit.
    - So I had to make tiny keycap to fit. I also uploaded this stl file.
- Angle of this keyboard wasn't too good and it moves when I typed.
    - I added paper clay to ajust angle and make it heavier.
